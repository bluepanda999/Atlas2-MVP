# Atlas2 Application Process Flow

## High-Level User Journey

### 1. Initial Setup & Configuration

- User logs in and navigates to the main dashboard
- User may configure **API Keys** for external services (via Settings page)
- User may explore **Integrations** to connect external data sources/services

### 2. Data Ingestion (CSV Upload)

- User uploads CSV files through the main interface
- System validates file format and structure
- Raw data is stored and prepared for processing

### 3. Field Mapping (Critical Step)

- User maps CSV columns to system-defined fields
- This is where **Integrations** play a key role:
  - Pre-built integrations provide field mapping templates
  - Integration templates suggest common mappings for specific data sources
  - Community connectors offer specialized mappings for niche systems

### 4. Data Processing & Transformation

- System processes mapped data according to business rules
- Data is transformed, validated, and enriched
- Integration-specific logic is applied (if using integrations)

### 5. Analytics & Monitoring

- Processed data flows to analytics engine
- Users can view dashboards and reports
- Real-time monitoring tracks data quality and processing status

## How Field Mapping Fits with Integrations

The **Integrations Marketplace** directly enhances the field mapping experience:

### Before Integrations:

- Manual field mapping for every CSV upload
- Users had to know the exact field names and formats
- No reusable patterns or templates

### After Integrations:

- **Integration Catalog**: Provides pre-configured field mappings for popular services
- **Template System**: Users can save and reuse field mapping patterns
- **Community Connectors**: Access to specialized mappings from other users
- **Testing Tools**: Validate field mappings before processing

## Key Integration Points

1. **Settings Page**: API key configuration enables integrations
2. **Integrations Page**: Marketplace for connecting external services
3. **Field Mapping UI**: Uses integration templates and patterns
4. **Data Processing**: Applies integration-specific transformations
5. **Analytics**: Shows integration performance and usage metrics

## Field Mapping: The Critical Bridge

The field mapping step is the crucial bridge where raw CSV data gets structured according to the integration patterns configured. This makes the entire data pipeline more efficient and standardized.

### Integration Benefits for Field Mapping:

- **Consistency**: Standardized mappings across similar data sources
- **Efficiency**: Reusable templates reduce manual configuration
- **Accuracy**: Pre-validated mappings reduce errors
- **Scalability**: Community contributions expand mapping coverage
- **Quality**: Testing tools ensure mapping validity before processing

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed Components:**
