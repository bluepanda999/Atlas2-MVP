#### 10.2 Scalability Requirements
**Technical Specifications:**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: All services must support horizontal scaling
- **Load Testing**: System must handle 100 concurrent users
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas for read-heavy operations
- **Cache Strategy**: Multi-level caching for frequently accessed data

**Performance Monitoring:**
```typescript
// Performance monitoring implementation
const performanceMiddleware = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const start = Date.now();
  
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = Date.now() - start;
    metrics.httpRequestDuration.observe(
      { method: req.method, route: req.route?.path, status: res.statusCode },
      duration
    );
  });
  
  next();
};
```

This comprehensive technical requirements specification provides the detailed implementation guidance needed for successful Atlas2 remediation while maintaining system stability and following BMad Method standards.
