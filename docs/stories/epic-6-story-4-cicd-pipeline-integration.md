# User Story: CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**Epic:** Epic 6: Docker Containerization  
**Story:** 6.4 - CI/CD Pipeline Integration  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Priority:** High  

## User Story

**As a** DevOps engineer,  
**I want** to integrate Docker containerization into a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline,  
**So that** Atlas2 can be automatically built, tested, secured, and deployed with minimal manual intervention while maintaining high quality and security standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Automated Build Pipeline
- **Given** I need to automate the container build process
- **When** code is pushed to the repository
- **Then** the pipeline must:
  - Automatically trigger Docker image builds
  - Use multi-stage builds with proper caching
  - Tag images with Git commit SHA and version
  - Push images to container registry
  - Store build artifacts and metadata

### AC2: Comprehensive Testing Integration
- **Given** I need to ensure quality before deployment
- **When** the pipeline runs
- **Then** it must include:
  - Unit tests execution in containerized environment
  - Integration tests with test database
  - End-to-end tests with staging environment
  - Performance and load testing
  - Security vulnerability scanning
  - Container image security scanning

### AC3: Security and Compliance Checks
- **Given** I need to maintain security standards
- **When** building and deploying containers
- **Then** the pipeline must:
  - Scan source code for security vulnerabilities
  - Scan container images for known vulnerabilities
  - Check for sensitive data exposure
  - Validate compliance with security policies
  - Generate security reports and attestations
  - Block deployment on critical security issues

### AC4: Automated Deployment Pipeline
- **Given** I need to deploy to multiple environments
- **When** pipeline stages complete successfully
- **Then** it must support:
  - Automated deployment to staging environment
  - Manual approval gates for production deployment
  - Blue-green or canary deployment strategies
  - Rollback capabilities on deployment failure
  - Environment-specific configuration management
  - Zero-downtime deployment for production

### AC5: Monitoring and Notification
- **Given** I need to track pipeline health and deployments
- **When** pipeline runs or deployments occur
- **Then** I must receive:
  - Real-time pipeline status notifications
  - Deployment success/failure alerts
  - Performance metrics after deployment
  - Security scan results and alerts
  - Rollback notifications when needed
  - Pipeline performance analytics

## Technical Requirements

### GitHub Actions Pipeline
```yaml
name: Build and Deploy Atlas2

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
      - name: Security scan
        run: |
          docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app trivy image app:latest

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t atlas2:${{ github.sha }} .
          docker tag atlas2:${{ github.sha }} registry.example.com/atlas2:latest
          docker push registry.example.com/atlas2:latest

  deploy-staging:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: |
          docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d

  deploy-production:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Container Registry Configuration
```yaml
# Registry configuration
registry:
  url: registry.example.com
  credentials:
    username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
  
image:
  name: atlas2
  tags:
    - latest
    - ${{ github.sha }}
    - ${{ github.ref_name }}
  
retention:
  policy: keep-last-20
  untagged: delete-after-30d
```

### Security Scanning Configuration
```yaml
security:
  sca:
    tools: [trivy, grype, snyk]
    fail_on: critical
  secrets:
    tools: [gitleaks, trufflehog]
    fail_on: high
  compliance:
    frameworks: [SOC2, ISO27001]
    policies: ./security-policies/
```

## Implementation Notes

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- Production deployment automation
- Security scanning integration
- Rollback procedure reliability

**Medium Risk:**
- Multi-environment configuration
- Pipeline performance optimization
- Monitoring integration complexity

**Low Risk:**
- Basic build automation
- Testing framework integration
- Documentation creation

## Additional Notes

This story completes the Docker containerization epic by implementing a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that automates the entire build, test, secure, and deploy process for Atlas2 containers.

The pipeline should be designed to provide fast feedback to developers while ensuring that only high-quality, secure code reaches production environments. Implementation should include proper error handling, monitoring, and rollback capabilities to maintain system reliability.

Regular maintenance and updates to the pipeline should be planned to keep up with changing security requirements, new tools, and evolving best practices in container-based deployments.
