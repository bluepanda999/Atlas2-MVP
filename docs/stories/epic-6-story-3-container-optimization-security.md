# User Story: Container Optimization & Security

**Epic:** Epic 6: Docker Containerization  
**Story:** 6.3 - Container Optimization & Security  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Priority:** High  

## User Story

**As a** DevOps engineer,  
**I want** to optimize Docker containers for performance and implement comprehensive security measures,  
**So that** Atlas2 runs efficiently in production while maintaining the highest security standards and minimizing resource consumption.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Container Image Optimization
- **Given** I need to optimize container images for production
- **When** I build the Docker images
- **Then** they must:
  - Use multi-stage builds to minimize final image size
  - Be based on minimal, secure base images (Alpine/Distroless)
  - Remove all unnecessary packages and dependencies
  - Optimize layer caching for faster builds
  - Have image size under 100MB for the application image

### AC2: Runtime Performance Optimization
- **Given** I need to optimize container runtime performance
- **When** I configure the containers
- **Then** they must:
  - Use appropriate resource limits and reservations
  - Implement efficient memory management
  - Optimize CPU allocation and usage
  - Configure proper garbage collection settings
  - Support efficient startup times (< 30 seconds)

### AC3: Advanced Security Hardening
- **Given** I need to implement comprehensive container security
- **When** I configure the containers
- **Then** they must include:
  - Non-root user execution with minimal privileges
  - Read-only filesystem with selective writable paths
  - Seccomp and AppArmor/SELinux profiles
  - Capabilities dropping (remove all non-essential capabilities)
  - Runtime security monitoring and alerting

### AC4: Vulnerability Management
- **Given** I need to maintain container security over time
- **When** I build and deploy containers
- **Then** I must have:
  - Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
  - Base image update automation
  - Dependency vulnerability monitoring
  - Security patch management process
  - Compliance reporting for security standards

### AC5: Resource Monitoring and Alerting
- **Given** I need to monitor container performance and security
- **When** containers are running in production
- **Then** I must be able to:
  - Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, network)
  - Track security events and anomalies
  - Set up alerts for performance degradation
  - Generate performance and security reports
  - Integrate with existing monitoring systems

## Technical Requirements

### Multi-Stage Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs18-debian11
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json

# Non-root user and security
USER 65534:65534
EXPOSE 3000
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "dist/main.js"]
```

### Security Configuration
```yaml
# Docker Compose security settings
services:
  web:
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
      - seccomp:./seccomp-profile.json
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:noexec,nosuid,size=100m
    ulimits:
      nofile:
        soft: 65536
        hard: 65536
```

### Resource Optimization
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '1.0'
      memory: 512M
    reservations:
      cpus: '0.25'
      memory: 256M
  restart_policy:
    condition: on-failure
    delay: 5s
    max_attempts: 3
    window: 120s
```

## Implementation Notes

### Image Optimization Strategies
- Multi-stage builds to separate build and runtime dependencies
- Minimal base images (Alpine Linux or Distroless)
- Layer optimization and caching strategies
- Removal of development tools and debug symbols
- Compression and optimization of static assets

### Security Implementation
- Container runtime security profiles
- Network segmentation and firewall rules
- Secret management integration
- Filesystem permissions and mount options
- Process isolation and privilege separation

### Performance Optimization
- Application-level optimizations
- Database connection pooling
- Caching strategies
- Resource allocation tuning
- Monitoring and profiling integration

## Additional Notes

This story focuses on making Atlas2 containers production-ready with comprehensive optimization and security measures. The implementation should follow industry best practices for container security and performance optimization.

The optimization process should balance security, performance, and maintainability while ensuring the containers remain easy to deploy and manage in production environments.

Regular security scanning and performance monitoring should be implemented to maintain the optimized state over time and quickly identify any regressions or new vulnerabilities.
