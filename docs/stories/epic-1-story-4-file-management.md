# Story 1.4: File Management & Storage - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a system administrator,
I want comprehensive file management capabilities including storage optimization, cleanup, and archival,
So that the system can efficiently manage large CSV files without running out of storage space.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: File upload system (Story 1.1), streaming processor (Story 1.2), validation service (Story 1.3)
- Technology: Node.js file system management, optional S3 integration, database metadata tracking
- Follows pattern: File management patterns, cleanup scheduling, metadata storage standards
- Touch points: File storage service, metadata database, cleanup scheduler, archival system

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Automatic file cleanup after processing completion with configurable retention periods
2. File compression and archival for long-term storage with optional cloud storage integration
3. Metadata tracking for all files including processing status, size, timestamps, and error counts
4. Storage monitoring with alerts when available space falls below threshold
5. File recovery capabilities for interrupted processing with resume functionality

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing file system APIs remain unchanged (new management endpoints only)
5. New functionality follows existing metadata and logging patterns
6. Integration with processing pipeline maintains current data flow architecture

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Storage optimization reduces disk usage by 60%+ through compression
8. File cleanup runs without impacting active processing jobs
9. Metadata queries return results within 100ms for common operations
10. System can handle 100+ concurrent files without storage conflicts

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** File management integrates with processing pipeline via event-driven cleanup and metadata tracking
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow established database patterns for metadata and existing logging standards
- **Key Constraints:** Must handle large files efficiently, provide reliable cleanup, support cloud storage options

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (unit and integration tests)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated (operations guide, storage policies)

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Premature file deletion causing data loss
- **Mitigation:** Implement retention policies, backup verification, and recovery mechanisms
- **Rollback:** Disable automatic cleanup and maintain manual file management if issues occur

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (new file_metadata table)
- [ ] File management follows existing service patterns
- [ ] Storage operations are atomic and reversible

## Story Points Estimation

**Estimation:** 5 points
- File cleanup and archival: 2 points
- Metadata tracking system: 2 points
- Storage monitoring and alerts: 1 point

## Dependencies

- File upload interface (Story 1.1)
- Streaming processor (Story 1.2)
- Database schema for metadata

## Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests:**
- File cleanup logic
- Metadata tracking functions
- Compression algorithms
- Storage monitoring calculations

**Integration Tests:**
- End-to-end file lifecycle
- Cleanup during active processing
- Cloud storage integration
- Recovery scenarios

**Performance Tests:**
- Large file cleanup speed
- Metadata query performance
- Storage usage under load
- Concurrent file operations

## Implementation Notes

**File Manager:**
```javascript
class FileManager {
  constructor(options) {
    this.retentionPeriod = options.retentionPeriod || 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 24 hours
    this.compressionEnabled = options.compressionEnabled || true;
    this.cloudStorage = options.cloudStorage;
  }
  
  async cleanupFile(fileId) {
    // Check retention policy
    // Compress if archival needed
    // Delete from local storage
    // Update metadata
  }
  
  async archiveFile(fileId) {
    // Compress file
    // Upload to cloud storage if configured
    // Update metadata with archival location
  }
}
```

**Metadata Tracking:**
```javascript
const fileMetadata = {
  id: 'uuid',
  originalName: 'data.csv',
  size: 1024000,
  uploadedAt: '2025-10-19T10:00:00Z',
  processedAt: '2025-10-19T10:05:00Z',
  status: 'completed',
  errorCount: 5,
  retentionUntil: '2025-10-20T10:00:00Z',
  archived: false,
  compressionRatio: 0.4
};
```

**Storage Monitor:**
```javascript
class StorageMonitor {
  constructor(threshold) {
    this.threshold = threshold || 0.8; // 80% usage threshold
  }
  
  async checkStorage() {
    const stats = await fs.statfs('./uploads');
    const usage = 1 - stats.bavail / stats.blocks;
    
    if (usage > this.threshold) {
      await this.triggerCleanup();
      await this.sendAlert(`Storage usage at ${(usage * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
    }
  }
}
```

**Cleanup Scheduler:**
```javascript
const cleanupJob = cron.schedule('0 */6 * * *', async () => {
  // Run every 6 hours
  const expiredFiles = await getExpiredFiles();
  for (const file of expiredFiles) {
    await fileManager.cleanupFile(file.id);
  }
});
```

**Error Handling:**
- File deletion failure: Log error, retry with exponential backoff
- Storage full: Pause uploads, trigger emergency cleanup
- Metadata corruption: Rebuild from file system scan
- Cloud storage failure: Keep local copy, retry upload later

## Success Criteria

- Automatic cleanup reduces storage usage by 60%+ through compression
- File metadata provides complete audit trail for all operations
- Storage monitoring prevents disk space exhaustion
- File recovery works for interrupted processing jobs
- System handles 100+ concurrent files without conflicts

## Monitoring and Observability

**Metrics to Track:**
- Storage usage percentage
- File cleanup success rate
- Compression ratios achieved
- Metadata query performance

**Alerts:**
- Storage usage >80%
- Cleanup failure rate >5%
- Metadata query latency >200ms
- File recovery failures

## Integration Points

**Upstream:**
- File upload service (new files)
- Processing pipeline (completion events)

**Downstream:**
- Storage system (file operations)
- Database (metadata)
- Monitoring service (alerts)
- Cloud storage (archival)

## Storage Policies

**Retention Rules:**
- Successful processing: 24 hours retention
- Failed processing: 72 hours retention (for debugging)
- Validation errors: 48 hours retention
- User-initiated uploads: 7 days retention

**Compression Settings:**
- Algorithm: gzip with level 6
- Target compression ratio: 60%+
- Compression timeout: 5 minutes per GB
- Verify compressed file integrity

**Archival Strategy:**
- Local: Compressed files for 30 days
- Cloud: All files after local retention
- Metadata: Permanent storage in database
- Recovery: 24-hour restoration from cloud
