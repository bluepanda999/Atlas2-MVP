# Story 1.2: Streaming CSV Processing Engine - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a system administrator,
I want the CSV processing engine to handle large files efficiently using streaming architecture,
So that the system can process 3GB files with minimal memory usage and maintain high performance.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: File upload system from Story 1.1, validation service, data storage layer
- Technology: Node.js backend with streaming libraries, Papa Parse or similar CSV parser
- Follows pattern: Event-driven processing, error handling frameworks, logging standards
- Touch points: File processing service, memory management, data validation pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Process CSV files using streaming architecture with configurable chunk sizes
2. Automatic delimiter detection (comma, semicolon, tab, pipe) with confidence scoring
3. UTF-8 encoding support with fallback to common encodings (ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252)
4. Memory usage never exceeds 500MB regardless of file size
5. Processing speed of at least 10,000 rows per second

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing file storage APIs remain unchanged (new processing endpoints only)
5. New functionality follows existing error handling and logging patterns
6. Integration with validation service maintains current data flow architecture

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Zero data loss during processing with row-by-row integrity checks
8. Graceful handling of malformed CSV rows with detailed error reporting
9. Processing can be paused and resumed for large files
10. Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Streaming processor integrates with file upload system via event-driven architecture
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow established error handling and logging patterns from existing services
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain memory efficiency, handle encoding detection, provide real-time progress

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (unit and integration tests)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated (technical specs, operations guide)

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Memory leaks during long-running processing jobs
- **Mitigation:** Implement strict memory monitoring and automatic cleanup processes
- **Rollback:** Fallback to simple file reading if streaming causes issues; maintain compatibility with existing file handling

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (new processing_logs table)
- [ ] Processing service follows existing microservice patterns
- [ ] Memory usage stays within defined limits

## Story Points Estimation

**Estimation:** 8 points
- Streaming architecture implementation: 3 points
- Delimiter and encoding detection: 2 points
- Memory management and monitoring: 2 points
- Performance optimization: 1 point

## Dependencies

- File upload interface (Story 1.1)
- CSV parsing library selection and integration
- Memory monitoring infrastructure

## Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests:**
- Streaming processor logic
- Delimiter detection algorithms
- Encoding detection accuracy
- Memory management functions

**Integration Tests:**
- End-to-end processing workflow
- Large file handling (actual 3GB test files)
- Memory usage under load
- Error recovery scenarios

**Performance Tests:**
- Processing speed benchmarks
- Memory usage profiling
- Concurrent processing capacity
- Long-running stability tests

## Implementation Notes

**Streaming Processor:**
```javascript
class StreamingCsvProcessor {
  constructor(filePath, options) {
    this.filePath = filePath;
    this.chunkSize = options.chunkSize || 1024 * 1024; // 1MB chunks
    this.encoding = options.encoding || 'utf-8';
  }
  
  async process() {
    // Stream file in chunks
    // Detect delimiter and encoding
    // Process rows incrementally
    // Monitor memory usage
  }
}
```

**Delimiter Detection:**
```javascript
function detectDelimiter(sample) {
  const delimiters = [',', ';', '\t', '|'];
  const scores = delimiters.map(del => ({
    delimiter: del,
    score: calculateConsistency(sample, del)
  }));
  return scores.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)[0];
}
```

**Memory Monitoring:**
```javascript
const memoryMonitor = {
  checkMemory: () => {
    const usage = process.memoryUsage();
    if (usage.heapUsed > 500 * 1024 * 1024) {
      // Trigger cleanup or pause processing
    }
  }
};
```

**Error Handling:**
- Malformed CSV rows: Log error, skip row, continue processing
- Memory threshold exceeded: Pause processing, trigger cleanup
- File access errors: Immediate failure with detailed error message
- Encoding detection failure: Fallback to UTF-8 with warning

## Success Criteria

- 3GB CSV files processed successfully with ≤500MB RAM usage
- Processing speed maintains ≥10,000 rows/second
- Automatic delimiter detection works with 95%+ accuracy
- UTF-8 encoding handling works for all common file sources
- Zero data loss during processing with integrity verification

## Monitoring and Observability

**Metrics to Track:**
- Processing speed (rows/second)
- Memory usage (heap, RSS)
- Error rates by category
- Processing queue depth

**Alerts:**
- Memory usage >400MB
- Processing speed <5,000 rows/second
- Error rate >5%
- Queue depth >10 files

## Integration Points

**Upstream:**
- File upload service (completed uploads)
- Configuration service (processing settings)

**Downstream:**
- Data validation service (processed rows)
- Storage service (processed data)
- Monitoring service (metrics and logs)
