# Story 1.1: CSV File Upload Interface - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a data analyst,
I want to upload CSV files through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface with real-time progress indication,
So that I can quickly and reliably import data into the Atlas2 system without technical barriers.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: New Atlas2 container-based architecture
- Technology: Node.js backend with Express.js, React frontend, Docker containers
- Follows pattern: RESTful API design, React component patterns, file upload middleware
- Touch points: File upload API endpoint, frontend upload component, validation service

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Users can upload CSV files using drag-and-drop or file picker interface
2. File validation checks for size limits (max 3GB), format, and basic structure
3. Real-time upload progress indication with percentage complete and estimated time remaining
4. Multiple file upload support with queue management

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing file system APIs remain unchanged (new upload endpoints only)
5. New functionality follows existing REST API pattern with proper HTTP status codes
6. Integration with validation service maintains current error handling approach

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Upload interface is responsive and works on desktop and tablet devices
8. File validation provides clear, actionable error messages
9. Upload progress updates smoothly without UI freezing
10. No regression in existing system performance during file uploads

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** New upload endpoints (`POST /api/upload`) integrate with existing Express.js middleware stack
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow established error handling and response format patterns from other API endpoints
- **Key Constraints:** Must handle large files without blocking the event loop, implement proper memory management

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (unit and integration tests)
- [ ] Documentation updated (API docs, user guide)

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Memory exhaustion during large file uploads
- **Mitigation:** Implement streaming upload with chunked processing and configurable memory limits
- **Rollback:** Disable new upload endpoints and revert to basic file handling if issues occur

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (new upload_logs table)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal during uploads

## Story Points Estimation

**Estimation:** 5 points
- Frontend upload component: 2 points
- Backend upload API: 2 points
- File validation and progress tracking: 1 point

## Dependencies

- Docker container infrastructure setup
- File storage configuration
- Frontend framework setup

## Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests:**
- File validation logic
- Upload progress calculation
- Error handling scenarios

**Integration Tests:**
- End-to-end file upload workflow
- Large file handling (mock 3GB file)
- Multiple concurrent uploads

**Performance Tests:**
- Memory usage during large uploads
- Upload speed with various file sizes
- Concurrent upload capacity

## Implementation Notes

**Frontend Component:**
```javascript
// React component structure
<CsvUploadComponent>
  <DropZone onDrop={handleFileUpload} />
  <ProgressBar progress={uploadProgress} />
  <FileList files={uploadedFiles} />
</CsvUploadComponent>
```

**Backend API:**
```javascript
// Express.js endpoint
app.post('/api/upload', uploadMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  // Streaming file processing
  // Validation checks
  // Progress tracking
});
```

**Error Handling:**
- File too large: 413 Payload Too Large
- Invalid format: 400 Bad Request
- Server error: 500 Internal Server Error with detailed logging

## Success Criteria

- Users can successfully upload CSV files up to 3GB
- Upload progress is accurately displayed in real-time
- File validation catches common issues before processing
- Interface remains responsive during uploads
- No memory leaks or performance degradation
