# User Story: Production Deployment Configuration

**Epic:** Epic 6: Docker Containerization  
**Story:** 6.2 - Production Deployment Configuration  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Priority:** High  

## User Story

**As a** DevOps engineer,  
**I want** to configure Docker containers for production deployment with environment-specific settings,  
**So that** Atlas2 can be reliably deployed to production environments with proper security, scaling, and monitoring capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Environment Configuration Management
- **Given** I have multiple deployment environments (development, staging, production)
- **When** I configure the Docker setup
- **Then** I must be able to:
  - Define environment-specific configuration files
  - Override default settings per environment
  - Manage secrets securely using environment variables or Docker secrets
  - Validate configuration before deployment

### AC2: Production-Ready Docker Compose
- **Given** I need to deploy Atlas2 to production
- **When** I use the production Docker Compose configuration
- **Then** it must include:
  - Production-optimized resource limits and reservations
  - Health checks for all services
  - Proper restart policies
  - Network isolation and security configurations
  - Volume management for persistent data

### AC3: Security Hardening
- **Given** I'm deploying to production
- **When** I configure the containers
- **Then** security measures must include:
  - Non-root user execution
  - Read-only filesystem where appropriate
  - Minimal base images with security scanning
  - Proper secret management (no hardcoded credentials)
  - Network segmentation between services

### AC4: Logging and Monitoring Integration
- **Given** I need to monitor production deployments
- **When** I configure the containers
- **Then** they must support:
  - Structured JSON logging output
  - Log aggregation to external systems
  - Health check endpoints for monitoring
  - Metrics exposure for Prometheus or similar
  - Distributed tracing correlation

### AC5: Scaling and Load Balancing
- **Given** I need to handle production load
- **When** I deploy multiple instances
- **Then** the configuration must support:
  - Horizontal scaling of web services
  - Load balancing configuration
  - Session management for scaled instances
  - Database connection pooling
  - Resource-based auto-scaling triggers

## Technical Requirements

### Docker Configuration
```yaml
# Production docker-compose.yml structure
services:
  web:
    image: atlas2:latest
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '1.0'
          memory: 1G
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 512M
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    user: "1001:1001"
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Production environment configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
REDIS_URL=${REDIS_URL}
JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET}
API_RATE_LIMIT=1000
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Security Configuration
- Non-root container execution
- Minimal attack surface
- Secret management integration
- Network policies
- Filesystem permissions

## Implementation Notes

### Configuration Management
- Use Docker Compose override files for environments
- Implement configuration validation
- Support for external configuration services
- Environment-specific build arguments

### Production Optimizations
- Multi-stage builds for minimal images
- Resource limits and reservations
- Health checks and graceful shutdown
- Connection pooling and caching

### Monitoring Integration
- Structured logging format
- Health check endpoints
- Metrics collection
- Distributed tracing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Production Docker Compose configuration created
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations implemented
- [ ] Security hardening measures applied
- [ ] Health checks and monitoring configured
- [ ] Documentation for deployment procedures
- [ ] Configuration validation scripts
- [ ] Load testing with production configuration
- [ ] Security scanning of container images
- [ ] Deployment automation scripts
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented

## Testing Requirements

### Configuration Testing
- Validate all environment configurations
- Test configuration overrides
- Verify secret management
- Test configuration validation

### Security Testing
- Container security scanning
- Permission validation
- Network security testing
- Secret management verification

### Production Readiness Testing
- Load testing with production configuration
- Failover and recovery testing
- Monitoring integration testing
- Deployment automation testing

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite:** Story 6.1 (Docker Environment Setup) must be completed
- **Required:** Production environment access and credentials
- **Required:** Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- **Required:** Security scanning tools integration

## Story Points: 8

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- Production security configuration
- Environment-specific settings management
- Monitoring and observability integration

**Medium Risk:**
- Load balancing configuration
- Resource optimization
- Deployment automation

**Low Risk:**
- Basic Docker Compose setup
- Environment variable management
- Health check configuration

## Additional Notes

This story focuses on making Atlas2 production-ready with proper Docker configuration. The implementation should follow DevOps best practices and ensure the application can be safely deployed to production environments with proper monitoring, security, and scaling capabilities.

The configuration should be flexible enough to support different deployment scenarios while maintaining security and reliability standards expected in production environments.
