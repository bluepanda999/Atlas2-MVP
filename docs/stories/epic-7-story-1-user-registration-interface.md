# Epic 7 Story 1: User Registration Interface - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a new user,
I want to register for an Atlas2 account through a web interface,
So that I can access the platform and start using its features.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing user authentication system and database schema
- Technology: React/TypeScript frontend, Node.js/Express API, PostgreSQL database
- Follows pattern: Existing form components and API integration patterns
- Touch points: User repository, authentication middleware, email service

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. User can access a registration form from the login page
2. Registration form collects username, email, password, and confirm password
3. Form validation ensures all fields are properly formatted and passwords match
4. Successful registration creates a user account and redirects to login
5. Duplicate email addresses are rejected with appropriate error messages

**Integration Requirements:** 4. Existing user authentication system continues to work unchanged 5. New registration functionality follows existing API response patterns 6. Integration with user repository maintains current database schema compatibility

**Quality Requirements:** 7. Registration form is responsive and follows existing UI design patterns 8. Input validation provides clear, helpful error messages 9. Password strength requirements are enforced 10. Registration process is secure and protects against common attacks

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** New React component that calls existing user creation API endpoints
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow existing form patterns from FileUpload.tsx and Input.tsx components
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain compatibility with existing user schema and authentication flow

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Registration flow conflicts with existing authentication middleware
- **Mitigation:** Thorough integration testing with existing login flow
- **Rollback:** Remove registration component and routes if conflicts arise

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing authentication APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (if any)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing Ant Design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

```typescript
// New component: src/components/auth/RegistrationForm.tsx
interface RegistrationFormData {
  username: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  confirmPassword: string;
}

interface RegistrationFormProps {
  onSuccess: () => void;
  onLoginClick: () => void;
}
```

### API Integration

- POST /api/auth/register endpoint (extend existing auth controller)
- Use existing UserRepository.create() method
- Follow existing error response patterns

### Validation Rules

- Username: 3-20 characters, alphanumeric + underscores
- Email: Valid email format
- Password: Minimum 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number
- Confirm Password: Must match password

### Security Considerations

- Password hashing using existing bcrypt implementation
- Rate limiting on registration endpoint
- Input sanitization and validation
- CSRF protection following existing patterns

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- Registration form component testing
- Form validation logic testing
- API integration testing

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end registration flow testing
- Database integration testing
- Authentication middleware compatibility testing

### Security Tests

- Input validation testing
- Rate limiting verification
- CSRF protection verification

## Success Metrics

- Registration conversion rate > 80%
- Form validation error rate < 5%
- Registration completion time < 2 minutes
- Zero security vulnerabilities in registration flow

_This story enhances the existing Atlas2 authentication system with user registration capabilities while maintaining full backward compatibility with current authentication mechanisms._
