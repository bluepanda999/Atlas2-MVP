# Epic 4: Simple Authentication - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement flexible authentication system supporting API Key, Basic Auth, and Bearer Token methods with secure credential management and seamless integration with API client generation.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: API client generation (Epic 2) provides endpoints but lacks authentication, field mapping (Epic 3) requires authenticated API access
- Technology stack: Node.js backend with Express.js, React frontend, container-based deployment
- Integration points: Authentication service, credential storage, API client integration, security middleware

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Multi-method authentication support (API Key, Basic Auth, Bearer Token), secure credential storage, runtime credential input, and automatic token management
- How it integrates: Provides authentication layer for all API client operations and secures credential handling throughout the application
- Success criteria: Support for 95%+ of common authentication methods, secure credential storage, seamless integration with existing API clients

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Authentication Method Implementation - Build support for API Key, Basic Auth, and Bearer Token with validation and error handling
2. **Story 2:** Secure Credential Management - Implement encrypted credential storage with runtime input and profile management
3. **Story 3:** API Client Authentication Integration - Integrate authentication system with generated API clients and handle token refresh

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged (new authentication endpoints only)
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible (new credential tables with encryption)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns (form components and security patterns)
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (efficient credential caching and retrieval)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Security vulnerabilities in credential storage or transmission
- **Mitigation:** Implement industry-standard encryption, secure transmission protocols, and regular security audits
- **Rollback Plan:** Fallback to runtime-only credential input if persistent storage proves problematic; maintain authentication interface compatibility

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (API client integration)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly (authentication → API clients → field mapping)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately (security guides, API documentation)
- [ ] No regression in existing features (API client generation and mapping)

## Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This integrates with API client generation (Epic 2) and supports field mapping (Epic 3) with Node.js backend and React frontend
- Integration points: Authentication service, credential storage, API client middleware, security components
- Existing patterns to follow: Security best practices, form validation patterns, error handling frameworks
- Critical compatibility requirements: Secure credential storage, multiple authentication methods, seamless API integration
- Each story must include verification that credentials are handled securely and authentication works with target APIs

The epic should provide robust authentication capabilities while maintaining security standards and user experience."

## Business Value

**Primary Value:**
- Enables secure API integration for enterprise environments
- Reduces authentication setup complexity with automatic detection
- Provides competitive advantage through comprehensive auth support

**Technical Value:**
- Establishes security framework for the application
- Creates reusable authentication patterns
- Enables enterprise-grade API integration

## Dependencies

**Technical Dependencies:**
- API client generation (Epic 2) for authentication integration
- Field mapping interface (Epic 3) for authenticated API access
- Security middleware and encryption libraries

**External Dependencies:**
- Encryption library (crypto or bcrypt)
- JWT handling library (jsonwebtoken)
- Security validation tools

## Risks

**High Priority Risks:**
- Credential storage security vulnerabilities
- Authentication method compatibility issues
- Token refresh and expiration handling

**Medium Priority Risks:**
- User interface security considerations
- Performance impact of encryption/decryption
- Cross-origin authentication challenges

## Acceptance Criteria Framework

**Functional Requirements:**
- Support API Key authentication (header, query parameter)
- Support Basic Authentication with secure encoding
- Support Bearer Token authentication
- Runtime credential input with validation
- Encrypted credential storage
- Multiple authentication profiles
- Automatic token refresh (where applicable)

**Security Requirements:**
- AES-256 encryption for stored credentials
- HTTPS-only credential transmission
- Secure credential handling in memory
- Protection against XSS and CSRF attacks
- Audit logging for authentication events

**Performance Requirements:**
- Credential validation: <500ms
- Authentication setup: <2 minutes
- Token refresh: <1 second
- UI response time: <200ms

## Success Metrics

- Authentication success rate: >99%
- Security audit compliance: 100%
- User setup time: <2 minutes for authentication
- Credential storage security: Zero plaintext storage

## Integration Points

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- User interface components (credential input forms)
- Security middleware (request interception)
- Configuration management (auth settings)

**Downstream Dependencies:**
- API client generation (authenticated requests)
- Field mapping interface (authenticated schema access)
- Upload management system (authenticated data transmission)

## Technical Specifications

**API Endpoints:**
```
POST /api/auth/validate
POST /api/auth/store
GET /api/auth/profiles
DELETE /api/auth/profiles/{id}
POST /api/auth/refresh
```

**Data Models:**
- AuthProfile: id, name, type, encrypted_credentials, api_spec_id, created_at
- Credential: type, value, encryption_metadata, expires_at
- AuthMethod: type, parameters, validation_rules, refresh_config

**Authentication Methods:**
1. **API Key**: Header-based or query parameter
2. **Basic Auth**: Username/password with Base64 encoding
3. **Bearer Token**: JWT or opaque token with refresh support

**Security Implementation:**
- Credential encryption using AES-256
- Secure key management with environment variables
- Memory cleanup after credential use
- Request signing for sensitive operations

## User Experience Flow

1. **Method Selection**: User chooses authentication type
2. **Credential Input**: User enters credentials securely
3. **Validation**: System validates credentials against target API
4. **Storage**: User chooses to save credentials securely
5. **Profile Management**: User can manage multiple authentication profiles
6. **Integration**: Authentication automatically applied to API requests

## Security Considerations

**Data Protection:**
- Never store credentials in plaintext
- Use environment variables for encryption keys
- Implement secure credential transmission
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

**Access Control:**
- Role-based access to credential management
- Audit logging for all authentication events
- Session management for credential access
- Secure credential sharing capabilities (future)

## Advanced Features (Post-MVP)

- OAuth 2.0 flow support
- Multi-factor authentication
- SSO integration
- Advanced token management
- Credential rotation policies
