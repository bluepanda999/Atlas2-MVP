# Epic 3: Visual Field Mapping Interface - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Create an intuitive drag-and-drop field mapping interface that enables users to visually connect CSV columns to API fields with advanced transformation capabilities and real-time validation.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: CSV processing (Epic 1) provides structured data, API client generation (Epic 2) provides target endpoints
- Technology stack: React frontend with TypeScript, Node.js backend, container-based deployment
- Integration points: CSV data preview service, API schema service, mapping validation engine, transformation processor

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Interactive drag-and-drop mapping interface, field concatenation builder, real-time validation, transformation rules engine, and mapping persistence
- How it integrates: Bridges CSV data structure to API requirements, enabling seamless data transformation before upload
- Success criteria: Intuitive visual mapping with <5-minute learning curve, support for complex transformations, real-time validation feedback

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Drag-and-Drop Mapping Interface - Build interactive visual mapping component with CSV preview and API field display
2. **Story 2:** Field Transformation Engine - Implement data type conversion, field concatenation, and conditional transformation rules
3. **Story 3:** Mapping Validation & Persistence - Create real-time validation with mapping save/load functionality and template management

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged (new mapping endpoints only)
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible (new mapping tables)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns (component library consistency)
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (efficient rendering with virtual scrolling)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Complex mapping scenarios causing UI performance issues or user confusion
- **Mitigation:** Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets, progressive disclosure for advanced features, and comprehensive user testing
- **Rollback Plan:** Fallback to simple dropdown-based mapping if drag-and-drop proves problematic; maintain mapping data structure compatibility

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (CSV data and API endpoints integration)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly (CSV preview → mapping interface → transformation engine)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately (user guides, mapping templates)
- [ ] No regression in existing features (data processing and API client generation)

## Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This bridges CSV processing (Epic 1) and API client generation (Epic 2) with React frontend and Node.js backend
- Integration points: CSV data preview API, API schema service, mapping validation engine, transformation processor
- Existing patterns to follow: React component patterns, drag-and-drop libraries, form validation patterns
- Critical compatibility requirements: Real-time validation, field transformation support, mapping persistence, intuitive UX
- Each story must include verification that mappings produce correct data transformations and integrate properly with upload system

The epic should provide an intuitive mapping experience that handles complex transformations while maintaining performance and usability."

## Business Value

**Primary Value:**
- Eliminates manual data transformation work, reducing setup time by 70%+
- Enables non-technical users to handle complex data mapping without coding
- Provides competitive advantage through superior user experience and flexibility

**Technical Value:**
- Creates reusable transformation framework
- Establishes pattern for visual data manipulation
- Enables advanced data processing capabilities

## Dependencies

**Technical Dependencies:**
- CSV processing engine (Epic 1) for data structure
- API client generation (Epic 2) for target schema
- Frontend drag-and-drop library integration

**External Dependencies:**
- React DnD or similar drag-and-drop library
- Data transformation library (lodash or similar)
- Form validation library (Yup or similar)

## Risks

**High Priority Risks:**
- Performance with large datasets (>10,000 rows)
- Complex transformation rule processing
- User interface complexity and learning curve

**Medium Priority Risks:**
- Browser compatibility for drag-and-drop
- Real-time validation performance
- Mapping template versioning

## Acceptance Criteria Framework

**Functional Requirements:**
- Drag-and-drop field mapping with visual feedback
- Field concatenation with custom separators
- Data type conversion (string, number, date, boolean)
- Conditional transformation rules
- Real-time validation with error indicators
- Mapping save/load functionality
- Template management and presets

**Performance Requirements:**
- UI response time: <200ms for mapping interactions
- Virtual scrolling support for 10,000+ rows
- Real-time validation: <100ms response
- Mapping save/load: <1 second

**Quality Requirements:**
- Intuitive user interface with <5-minute learning curve
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Success Metrics

- User task completion rate: >95% for mapping creation
- Average mapping setup time: <5 minutes
- User satisfaction score: >4.5/5 for usability
- Mapping accuracy rate: >99% for transformations

## Integration Points

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- CSV processing pipeline (source data structure)
- API client generation (target field definitions)
- Authentication system (for API schema access)

**Downstream Dependencies:**
- Upload management system (transformed data)
- Error handling framework (mapping validation errors)
- Export functionality (mapping templates)

## Technical Specifications

**API Endpoints:**
```
GET /api/csv/{id}/preview
GET /api/specs/{id}/schema
POST /api/mapping/validate
POST /api/mapping/save
GET /api/mapping/{id}/load
```

**Data Models:**
- Mapping: id, csv_id, api_spec_id, field_mappings, transformations, created_at
- FieldMapping: source_field, target_field, transformation_type, parameters
- Transformation: type, source_fields, parameters, validation_rules

**Frontend Components:**
- MappingCanvas: Main drag-and-drop interface
- FieldPreview: CSV column preview with sample data
- TransformationBuilder: Rule configuration interface
- ValidationPanel: Real-time error display

## User Experience Flow

1. **Data Preview**: User sees CSV columns with sample data
2. **Target Selection**: User selects API endpoint and sees required fields
3. **Visual Mapping**: User drags CSV columns to API fields
4. **Transformation**: User configures data transformations as needed
5. **Validation**: System validates mappings in real-time
6. **Save**: User saves mapping configuration for reuse

## Advanced Features (Post-MVP)

- Bulk mapping operations
- AI-powered mapping suggestions
- Mapping templates library
- Collaborative mapping features
- Advanced transformation scripts
