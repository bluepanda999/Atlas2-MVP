# Epic 3: Visual Field Mapping Interface - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement an intuitive visual field mapping interface that enables users to map CSV data columns to API endpoint parameters through drag-and-drop interactions, supporting complex data transformations and validation.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: CSV processing pipeline (Epic 1) provides structured data, API client generation (Epic 2) provides target endpoints
- Technology stack: React frontend with TypeScript, Node.js backend, drag-and-drop libraries, container-based deployment
- Integration points: CSV data preview API, API schema service, mapping validation engine, transformation processor

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Visual drag-and-drop mapping interface, field transformation engine, mapping validation and persistence system
- How it integrates: Bridges CSV data processing with API client generation, enabling seamless data flow from source to target
- Success criteria: <5-minute learning curve for users, support for complex transformations, real-time validation feedback

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Drag-and-Drop Mapping Interface - Build intuitive visual interface for mapping CSV columns to API parameters
2. **Story 2:** Field Transformation Engine - Implement data transformation logic with support for common operations
3. **Story 3:** Mapping Validation & Persistence - Create validation system and storage for mapping configurations

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing CSV processing APIs remain unchanged (new mapping endpoints only)
- [ ] API client generation system integration is additive (new mapping configuration support)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing Ant Design patterns and component library
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (mapping operations are client-side optimized)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Complex transformation logic causing performance issues or incorrect data mapping
- **Mitigation:** Implement client-side validation, transformation preview, and rollback capabilities
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable mapping interface and fall back to manual field configuration if issues occur

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (CSV processing and API generation)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly (CSV data → mapping → API client)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately (user guides, API docs)
- [ ] No regression in existing features (CSV upload and API generation remain functional)

## Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This bridges Epic 1 (CSV processing) and Epic 2 (API client generation) with React frontend and Node.js backend
- Integration points: CSV data preview API, API schema service, mapping validation engine, transformation processor
- Existing patterns to follow: React component patterns, RESTful API design, Ant Design components
- Critical compatibility requirements: <5-minute learning curve, drag-and-drop functionality, complex transformation support
- Each story must include verification that mappings work correctly with both CSV data and API schemas

The epic should provide an intuitive mapping experience while maintaining data integrity and supporting complex business transformations."
