# Epic 2: Basic API Client Generation - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement dynamic API client generation from OpenAPI specifications that enables automatic endpoint discovery, request/response template creation, and seamless integration with the data processing pipeline.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: CSV processing engine from Epic 1 provides structured data ready for API integration
- Technology stack: Node.js backend with Express.js, React frontend, container-based deployment
- Integration points: Specification import service, client generation engine, endpoint browser UI, authentication system

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: OpenAPI 3.x and Swagger 2.0 specification parsing, dynamic client generation, visual endpoint browser, and request/response template system
- How it integrates: Connects processed CSV data to target APIs through dynamically generated clients
- Success criteria: Support 95%+ of OpenAPI specifications, automatic endpoint discovery, real-time client generation

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** OpenAPI Specification Import - Build specification parser with validation and error handling for OpenAPI 3.x and Swagger 2.0
2. **Story 2:** Dynamic Client Generation Engine - Create runtime client generation with request/response template creation
3. **Story 3:** Visual Endpoint Browser - Implement interactive endpoint discovery interface with search and filtering capabilities

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged (new API client generation endpoints)
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible (new tables for specifications and templates)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns (established component library)
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (client generation is on-demand and cached)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Inconsistent OpenAPI specification implementations causing client generation failures
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing suite with real-world API specifications and graceful degradation for unsupported features
- **Rollback Plan:** Fallback to manual endpoint configuration if automatic generation fails; maintain specification import for manual client creation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (CSV processing integration)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly (specification import → client generation → endpoint browser)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately (API docs, integration guides)
- [ ] No regression in existing features (CSV processing remains functional)

## Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This integrates with the CSV processing system from Epic 1 and runs on Node.js backend with React frontend
- Integration points: Specification import API, client generation service, endpoint browser component, authentication system
- Existing patterns to follow: RESTful API design, React component patterns, error handling frameworks
- Critical compatibility requirements: OpenAPI 3.x and Swagger 2.0 support, real-time client generation, endpoint discovery
- Each story must include verification that generated clients work with target APIs and handle authentication properly

The epic should provide seamless API integration capabilities while maintaining flexibility for various specification formats."

## Business Value

**Primary Value:**
- Eliminates manual API integration work, reducing development time by 80%+
- Enables zero-code API connectivity for non-technical users
- Provides competitive advantage through universal API compatibility

**Technical Value:**
- Creates reusable client generation framework
- Establishes pattern for dynamic configuration
- Enables rapid API onboarding for new services

## Dependencies

**Technical Dependencies:**
- CSV processing engine (Epic 1)
- Authentication system foundation
- Frontend component library setup

**External Dependencies:**
- OpenAPI parsing library (swagger-parser or similar)
- HTTP client library (Axios or node-fetch)
- API specification validation tools

## Risks

**High Priority Risks:**
- Inconsistent OpenAPI specification quality
- Complex authentication method handling
- Performance with large specifications

**Medium Priority Risks:**
- Unsupported specification features
- Real-time validation accuracy
- Client generation caching strategies

## Acceptance Criteria Framework

**Functional Requirements:**
- Support OpenAPI 3.x and Swagger 2.0 specifications
- Automatic endpoint discovery and categorization
- Dynamic client generation with authentication support
- Visual endpoint browser with search and filtering
- Request/response template creation

**Performance Requirements:**
- Specification parsing: <5 seconds for complex specs
- Client generation: <2 seconds per endpoint
- UI response time: <200ms for interactions
- Cache hit ratio: >90% for repeated specifications

**Quality Requirements:**
- 95%+ specification compatibility rate
- Comprehensive error handling for malformed specs
- Real-time validation feedback
- Support for common authentication methods

## Success Metrics

- Specification compatibility rate: >95%
- Client generation success rate: >98%
- User task completion rate: >90% for API setup
- Average time to first API call: <3 minutes

## Integration Points

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- CSV processing pipeline (data source)
- Authentication system (credential management)
- Configuration management (settings storage)

**Downstream Dependencies:**
- Field mapping interface (data transformation)
- Upload management system (data transmission)
- Error handling framework (failure reporting)

## Technical Specifications

**API Endpoints:**
```
POST /api/specs/import
GET /api/specs/{id}/endpoints
POST /api/clients/generate
GET /api/clients/{id}/template
```

**Data Models:**
- Specification: id, content, format, validation_status, imported_at
- Endpoint: path, method, parameters, responses, authentication_type
- Client: spec_id, endpoint_id, template, authentication_config

**Caching Strategy:**
- Specification parsing results: 24-hour TTL
- Generated client templates: 12-hour TTL
- Endpoint metadata: 6-hour TTL
