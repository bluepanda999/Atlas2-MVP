# Epic 7: User Management & Access Control

**Epic ID:** EPIC-007  
**Created:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** Draft  
**Priority:** High  
**Epic Owner:** Product Owner

## Epic Overview

This epic focuses on implementing comprehensive user management and access control capabilities for Atlas2. The system currently has basic authentication infrastructure but lacks a complete user interface for registration, login, profile management, and team collaboration features. This epic will enhance the existing authentication system with user-friendly interfaces and role-based access control (RBAC) to support multi-user scenarios and team workflows.

## Business Problem

Atlas2 currently operates as a single-user system with limited user management capabilities. As the platform grows, there is a critical need for:

1. **User Onboarding**: Easy registration and login processes for new users
2. **Access Control**: Proper role-based permissions to secure sensitive operations
3. **User Management**: Administrative tools for user account management
4. **Team Collaboration**: Features that enable multiple users to work together effectively

## Epic Goals

### Primary Goals

- Implement a complete user registration and login interface
- Establish role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Create user profile management capabilities
- Develop team collaboration features

### Secondary Goals

- Enhance security with proper session management
- Improve user experience with intuitive authentication flows
- Provide administrative tools for user management
- Enable audit logging for user actions

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can register new accounts through a web interface
- [ ] Users can log in and log out securely
- [ ] Role-based permissions control access to features
- [ ] Users can manage their profiles and preferences
- [ ] Administrators can manage user accounts and permissions
- [ ] Team members can collaborate on shared resources

### Technical Success Criteria

- [ ] Authentication integrates with existing API key system
- [ ] Session management is secure and performant
- [ ] UI components follow existing design patterns
- [ ] All user actions are properly audited
- [ ] System maintains backward compatibility

### Business Success Criteria

- [ ] User adoption increases by 25%
- [ ] Security incidents related to access control decrease by 90%
- [ ] Administrative overhead for user management reduces by 50%
- [ ] Team collaboration efficiency improves by 40%

## Scope

### In Scope

1. **User Registration & Login UI**
   - Registration form with validation
   - Login form with remember me functionality
   - Password reset functionality
   - Email verification process

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Implementation of RBAC permissions
   - Role assignment and management
   - Permission-based UI component rendering
   - API endpoint protection

3. **User Profile Management**
   - Profile editing interface
   - Password change functionality
   - Preference management
   - Account deactivation

4. **Team Collaboration Features**
   - Team creation and management
   - Resource sharing within teams
   - Team member invitation system
   - Collaborative mapping configurations

### Out of Scope

- Advanced single sign-on (SSO) integration
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Advanced user analytics and reporting
- External directory service integration (LDAP/Active Directory)

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Existing authentication middleware and services
- Current user database schema
- API key authentication system
- Frontend component library (Ant Design)

### External Dependencies

- Email service for user verification
- Password hashing libraries
- JWT token management

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Integration conflicts with existing authentication system
  **Mitigation**: Incremental implementation with comprehensive testing

- **Risk**: Performance impact from additional authentication checks
  **Mitigation**: Efficient caching strategies and optimized database queries

- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in new authentication flows
  **Mitigation**: Security review and penetration testing

### Business Risks

- **Risk**: User adoption resistance due to complexity
  **Mitigation**: User-centric design and comprehensive onboarding

- **Risk**: Administrative overhead for user management
  **Mitigation**: Automated user management tools and clear documentation

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Stories 1-2)

- User registration and login UI
- Basic RBAC implementation

### Phase 2: User Management (Stories 3-4)

- User profile management
- Administrative user management tools

### Phase 3: Collaboration (Stories 5-6)
