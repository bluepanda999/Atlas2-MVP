# Epic 1: CSV File Upload & Processing - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement robust CSV file upload and streaming processing capabilities that handle large files efficiently while providing real-time validation and preview functionality.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: New Atlas2 project with container-based architecture planned
- Technology stack: Docker-based deployment with Node.js backend and React frontend (planned)
- Integration points: File upload API, validation service, processing engine, frontend UI components

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Complete CSV processing pipeline with streaming architecture, automatic delimiter detection, UTF-8 encoding support, and real-time data preview
- How it integrates: Core data ingestion layer that feeds into field mapping and API upload components
- Success criteria: Process 3GB CSV files with ≤500MB RAM usage, 10,000+ rows/second processing speed, real-time validation feedback

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** CSV File Upload Interface - Implement drag-and-drop file upload with file validation and progress indication
2. **Story 2:** Streaming CSV Processing Engine - Build memory-efficient processing with automatic delimiter detection and encoding handling
3. **Story 3:** Data Validation & Preview - Create real-time validation with sample data preview and error reporting

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged (this is foundational functionality)
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible (new tables only)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns (establish design system)
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (streaming architecture ensures efficiency)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Memory overflow when processing large files (>1GB)
- **Mitigation:** Implement streaming processing with chunked reading and configurable memory limits
- **Rollback Plan:** Fallback to simple file reading if streaming causes issues; maintain compatibility with existing file handling

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (baseline functionality)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly (file upload → processing → validation)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately (API docs, user guides)
- [ ] No regression in existing features (new functionality only)

## Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is foundational functionality for a new system running Node.js backend with React frontend in Docker containers
- Integration points: File upload API endpoint, validation service, data processing engine, frontend upload component
- Existing patterns to follow: Container-based architecture, RESTful API design, React component patterns
- Critical compatibility requirements: Streaming processing for memory efficiency, UTF-8 encoding support, automatic delimiter detection
- Each story must include verification that file processing maintains data integrity and handles edge cases

The epic should establish the core data ingestion foundation while maintaining system stability and performance standards."

## Business Value

**Primary Value:**
- Enables the core data input capability for the entire Atlas2 platform
- Provides competitive advantage through superior large file handling
- Reduces user friction with automatic format detection and validation

**Technical Value:**
- Establishes streaming architecture pattern for other components
- Provides reusable validation framework
- Creates foundation for error handling and reporting systems

## Dependencies

**Technical Dependencies:**
- Docker container infrastructure setup
- File storage configuration (local filesystem with optional S3)
- Frontend framework selection and setup

**External Dependencies:**
- CSV parsing library selection (Papa Parse or similar)
- File upload middleware configuration

## Risks

**High Priority Risks:**
- Memory management with large files
- File encoding detection accuracy
- Concurrent upload handling

**Medium Priority Risks:**
- File format edge cases (malformed CSVs)
- Browser file upload limitations
- Performance under load

## Acceptance Criteria Framework

**Functional Requirements:**
- Support CSV files up to 3GB in size
- Automatic delimiter detection (comma, semicolon, tab, pipe)
- UTF-8 encoding support with fallback handling
- Real-time validation feedback
- Sample data preview (first 100 rows)

**Performance Requirements:**
- Processing speed: ≥10,000 rows/second
- Memory usage: ≤500MB for 3GB files
- Upload progress indication
- UI response time: <200ms

**Quality Requirements:**
- Zero data loss during processing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Graceful degradation for malformed files
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Success Metrics

- File processing success rate: >99%
- Average processing speed: 10,000+ rows/second
- Memory efficiency: ≤500MB usage for 3GB files
- User task completion rate: >95% for file upload and validation
