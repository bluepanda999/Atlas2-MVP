# Epic 5: Progress Monitoring & Error Reporting - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement comprehensive progress monitoring and error reporting system that provides real-time upload tracking, detailed error categorization, and actionable recovery suggestions for failed operations.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: CSV processing (Epic 1), API clients (Epic 2), field mapping (Epic 3), and authentication (Epic 4) provide complete data pipeline but lack visibility into operation status
- Technology stack: Node.js backend with Express.js, React frontend with WebSocket support, container-based deployment
- Integration points: Upload management service, error classification engine, progress tracking system, reporting dashboard

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Real-time progress monitoring with WebSocket updates, comprehensive error classification and reporting, failed row export capabilities, and recovery suggestion engine
- How it integrates: Provides visibility and control over the entire data upload pipeline with actionable insights for troubleshooting
- Success criteria: Real-time progress updates with 1-second refresh, detailed error categorization, actionable recovery suggestions, failed data export capabilities

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Real-Time Progress Monitoring - Implement WebSocket-based progress tracking with live status updates and performance metrics
2. **Story 2:** Error Classification & Reporting - Build comprehensive error categorization system with detailed error analysis and trend reporting
3. **Story 3:** Recovery & Export Tools - Create failed row export functionality with bulk error correction and retry capabilities

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged (new monitoring and reporting endpoints)
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible (new logging and error tables)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns (dashboard components and notification systems)
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (efficient WebSocket communication and optimized queries)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** High-frequency WebSocket updates causing performance issues or browser overload
- **Mitigation:** Implement efficient update batching, configurable refresh rates, and graceful degradation to polling
- **Rollback Plan:** Fallback to HTTP-based polling if WebSocket proves problematic; maintain progress tracking data structure compatibility

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (upload pipeline integration)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly (progress monitoring → error reporting → recovery tools)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately (troubleshooting guides, error reference)
- [ ] No regression in existing features (data processing and API integration)

## Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This provides visibility into the complete data pipeline (Epics 1-4) with React frontend, Node.js backend, and WebSocket communication
- Integration points: Upload management service, error classification engine, progress tracking system, reporting dashboard
- Existing patterns to follow: Real-time communication patterns, error handling frameworks, dashboard design patterns
- Critical compatibility requirements: Real-time updates, comprehensive error reporting, export capabilities, recovery suggestions
- Each story must include verification that progress tracking is accurate and error reporting provides actionable insights

The epic should provide complete visibility into data operations with actionable insights for troubleshooting and recovery."

```
GET /api/upload/{id}/progress
GET /api/upload/{id}/errors
POST /api/upload/{id}/export
GET /api/upload/{id}/status
WebSocket: /ws/progress/{uploadId}
```
