# Epic 6: Docker Containerization - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Create comprehensive Docker containerization setup that enables simplified deployment, consistent environments, and scalable architecture for the Atlas2 application with production-ready configuration.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Complete application functionality from Epics 1-5 requires deployment infrastructure for consistent operation across environments
- Technology stack: Node.js backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL database, Redis cache, container-based deployment architecture
- Integration points: Docker build system, container orchestration, environment configuration, volume management, networking setup

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Multi-container Docker setup with web application, API processing, database, and cache containers; production-ready configuration; environment management; and deployment automation
- How it integrates: Provides the foundational deployment infrastructure that enables consistent operation and scaling of all application components
- Success criteria: Single-command deployment, environment consistency, production-ready configuration, horizontal scaling capability

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Multi-Container Docker Setup - Create Docker configuration for web app, API processing, database, and cache containers with proper networking
2. **Story 2:** Production Configuration - Implement environment-specific configurations, security settings, and optimization for production deployment
3. **Story 3:** Deployment Automation - Build deployment scripts, health checks, and monitoring setup with volume management and backup strategies

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged (containerized deployment only)
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible (containerized database setup)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns (containerized frontend serving)
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (optimized container configurations)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Container configuration issues causing deployment failures or performance problems
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing across environments, standardized configuration patterns, and rollback procedures
- **Rollback Plan:** Maintain standalone deployment option; use versioned container images for safe rollbacks

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (all application components in containers)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly (container networking, volume mounting, environment configuration)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately (deployment guides, configuration reference)
- [ ] No regression in existing features (application functionality unchanged in containerized environment)

## Story Manager Handoff:

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This containers the complete application (Epics 1-5) with multi-container Docker setup including web, API, database, and cache
- Integration points: Docker build system, container orchestration, environment configuration, volume management, networking
- Existing patterns to follow: Docker best practices, container security standards, environment management patterns
- Critical compatibility requirements: Production-ready configuration, environment consistency, deployment automation, monitoring setup
- Each story must include verification that containers work correctly and maintain application functionality

The epic should provide robust containerization that enables simplified deployment and scaling while maintaining security and performance standards."
