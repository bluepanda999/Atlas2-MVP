### Critical Path Analysis

**Primary Dependencies:**
- Epic 1 (CSV Processing) → Epic 2 (API Client Generation)
- Epic 2 → Epic 3 (Field Mapping)
- Epic 3 → Epic 4 (Authentication)
- Epic 4 → Epic 5 (Progress Monitoring)

**Supporting Dependencies:**
- All previous epics support Epic 5 (Progress Monitoring)
- All epics are containerized in Epic 6

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-6)
**Epics:** 1 (CSV Processing) + 2 (API Client Generation)  
**Deliverable:** Basic data processing and API integration capabilities  
**MVP Criteria:** Users can upload CSV files and connect to basic APIs

### Phase 2: User Experience (Weeks 7-11)
**Epics:** 3 (Field Mapping) + 4 (Authentication)  
**Deliverable:** Complete user workflow with security  
**MVP Criteria:** Users can map fields and authenticate with APIs

### Phase 3: Operations (Weeks 12-15)
**Epics:** 5 (Progress Monitoring) + 6 (Docker Containerization)  
**Deliverable:** Production-ready deployment and monitoring  
**MVP Criteria:** System is deployable and observable in production

## Risk Assessment
