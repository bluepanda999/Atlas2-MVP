# Root Causes Summary: Atlas2 Architectural Gaps

## Quick Reference

### Testing Infrastructure Crisis
**Root Cause:** No technical leadership enforcing quality standards  
**Primary Issue:** Culture of speed over sustainable engineering practices  
**Fix Required:** Implement quality gates and testing requirements

### File Upload Architecture Limitation  
**Root Cause:** MVP-first mentality without scalability planning  
**Primary Issue:** Requirements gap between business needs and technical implementation  
**Fix Required:** Complete re-architecture to streaming-based processing

### Authentication System Incompleteness
**Root Cause:** Security treated as afterthought, not foundational requirement  
**Primary Issue:** Missing security expertise and governance  
**Fix Required:** Implement comprehensive authentication framework

### Monitoring Integration Gap
**Root Cause:** Siloed development-operations responsibilities  
**Primary Issue:** Incomplete feature implementation and integration  
**Fix Required:** Connect existing metrics to monitoring infrastructure

## Cross-Cutting Systemic Issues

1. **Missing Technical Governance** - No architecture review or quality gates
2. **Incomplete Requirements Analysis** - Performance, security, ops requirements not captured
3. **Siloed Development Practices** - Dev, test, security, ops not integrated
4. **Tooling Without Process** - Sophisticated tools but no usage processes
5. **Culture of Speed Over Quality** - Technical debt accumulated for velocity

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Week 1:** Connect metrics endpoint, establish basic quality gates
2. **Month 1:** Implement testing strategy, design streaming upload, develop auth framework  
3. **Quarter 1:** Establish technical governance, implement DevOps practices

## Key Insight

These are not isolated technical problems but symptoms of deeper systemic issues in development culture and governance. Fixing the root causes is essential for preventing recurrence.
