next_steps:
  - "Fix TypeScript typing errors immediately"
  - "Create unit tests for job queue service"
  - "Performance testing under load"
  - "Final gate review after conditions met"

notes: |
  Excellent job queue implementation with advanced scheduling and resource 
  management capabilities. Performance exceeds expectations. However, TypeScript 
  errors must be resolved immediately as they are blocking compilation. 
  Test coverage is also critically missing.
