## Pitch

Atlas is a comprehensive CSV to API mapping and upload tool that eliminates the need for manual coding when migrating bulk data between CSV files and REST APIs. The application dynamically generates API clients from OpenAPI specifications, processes CSV files with advanced field mapping capabilities, and handles concurrent uploads with enterprise-grade authentication and error handling.

## Users

### Primary Users
- **Data Analysts and Migration Specialists**: Professionals responsible for moving data between systems who need reliable, efficient tools for bulk data operations without requiring programming expertise
- **DevOps Engineers**: Infrastructure and deployment specialists handling data integration tasks across multiple environments and systems
- **Enterprise Developers**: Software developers working on data upload and migration projects who need to streamline API data operations

### Secondary Users  
- **Business Users**: Non-technical stakeholders requiring self-service data upload capabilities for routine business operations
- **System Administrators**: IT professionals managing data flows and integration processes across enterprise systems

## The Problem

Organizations frequently need to migrate large volumes of data from CSV files to REST APIs, but existing solutions require:

- **Manual Coding**: Writing custom scripts for each API integration, consuming significant development time
- **Complex Setup**: Configuring authentication, handling rate limiting, and managing concurrent requests manually
- **Limited Reusability**: API-specific solutions that cannot be easily adapted for different endpoints
- **Poor Error Handling**: Inadequate feedback when uploads fail, making troubleshooting difficult
- **Scalability Issues**: Solutions that break down with large datasets or high-concurrency requirements

These challenges result in delayed data migration projects, increased development costs, and reduced operational efficiency.
